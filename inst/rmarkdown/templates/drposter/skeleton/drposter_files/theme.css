/* New todo list, for the next commit so everything's not all at once as a huge incomprehensible commit:
 * The .section .level2 margin-top currently makes sense based on line heights but should be calculated appropriately, etc.
 * Continue using CSS variables to simplify specifications (and intent) for heights, spacing, distances, etc.
 * Is there a way to space the bullet points halfway closer to the content?  They're too close to the 1cm margin right now.
 * Note: systematically fixing issues with .level2 will make theming considerably easier.  Consider that you can disable most of the .level2 h2 styles and apply width=100%, border-bottom:solid black, and remove the .level2 border to get a totally minimalist poster relatively easy.  If you had a special class attached to the .level1 or .slides/theme, you could use a general descendent selector to automatically get theming support, then break up these details into separate theme files.  Note you could also use this to make a "real" poster to demonstrate the project like tikzposter, where you have different styles demo'd on the same example poster.
 * There's also some old code that should be moved to an examples.css for override examples for the template, since it doesn't belong cluttering the default style.  Then, everything will all be in a single place.
 * Documentation: explain the philosophy of organizing the project with a drposter_files/ subdirectory to give the user full control of which version of the CSS, etc., is employed.
 * header.css: the paddings really should be standardized somewhere within the document, which would have the side benefit of simplifying all of the CSS
 * flex of 45% isn't actually working, even with the padding, etc.  Need to figure out how textbox contents should work.  Padding?  Margins?  Think though this with the upcoming whitespace redesign, which will also cull unnecessary styles.
 * Maybe it would be a good idea to give the headers a consistent line height, e.g. 1.1em?  Especially considering that the font sizes are currently all over the place on the document.
 * Still consider embedding the default fonts (and maybe add a notice for users who want custom fonts), since they don't work offline.  The note in the license section could be something along the lines of "...and fonts under their respective licenses".  The trickiest part will be figuring out how the Google Fonts css imports these and best practices of what I should do with the ttf files.
